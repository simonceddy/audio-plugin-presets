# Audio Plugin Presets

___

This repository contains numerous preset files for a variety of VST/AU plugins I use.

The repository is organised into directories like so:

```sh
/manufacturer-name
    /plugin-name
        /preset files
    /plugin-name
        /preset files
    etc...
/manufacturer-name
    /plugin-name
        /preset files
    /plugin-name
        /preset files
    etc...
etc...
```

Storing the presets will differ depending on OS and potentially the plugin host.

On macOS the locations are usually either one of \(or both\) `./Users/{your username}/Library/Audio/Presets/{manufacturer name}/{plugin name}` or `./Library/Audio/Presets/{manufacturer name}/{plugin name}`.

Directories contain additional readmes where more detailed or manufacturer specific installation instructions can be found.

So far I have uploaded presets for the following:

- Glitchmachines Fracture
- Glitchmachines Fracture XT
- Glitchmachines Hysteresis

More to come.
